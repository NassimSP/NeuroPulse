## 💡 Original Core Business Ideas

### 1. Experience Bank / Achievement Memory System
**Concept**: A lifelong personal database of experiences, achievements, and skills for easy reference during job applications.

**Why It Matters to You**:
- You're actively applying for apprenticeships
- You've mentioned forgetting relevant experiences
- Would immediately help your current situation

**Zero-Cost MVP**:
- Google Sheets database
- ChatGPT for matching
- Basic HTML interface on GitHub Pages

**Time to MVP**: 8-10 hours total

**Revenue Path**:
- Free for first users
- £2.99/month after 50 users
- No money needed upfront

---

### 2. Custom AI Learning Platform for Neurodivergent Learners
**Concept**: ADHD-optimized learning using quizzes, gamification, and 5-minute sessions.

**Personal Connection**:
- Based on your Reed courses frustration
- Your success with ChatGPT quiz creation
- Solves your actual learning struggles

**Zero-Cost Build**:
- Start with one topic (job interview prep?)
- Use free GPT API credits
- Host on Vercel free tier

**Why Wait?**: More complex than job assistant, better as project #2

---

### 3. Human-AI Onboarding System
**Concept**: Helps AI understand individuals better through structured personality/preference capture.

**Your Insight**: 
- Ahead of the market
- But requires B2B sales
- Better when you have more stability

## 💭 Ideas Parking Lot
*When ADHD brain has new ideas, put them here:*

## 🎖️ Remember:

**You are not behind. You are not too late. You are not under-resourced.**

You are a care leaver with ADHD who's actively building their future while navigating systems that weren't designed for you. That's not naive - that's brave.

Every successful product started with someone solving their own problem with whatever they had available.

You have:
- A real problem (job applications)
- The tools to solve it (free AI)
- The time to build it (8 hours/week)
- The story to sell it (authentic struggle)

**That's all you need.**

## 📞 Check-In Reminder:

Come back to this document:
- Every Monday (plan your week)
- When feeling overwhelmed
- When new ideas strike
- When doubting yourself

This is your north star. One idea. One sprint. One small win at a time.

**You've got this.** 🚀
