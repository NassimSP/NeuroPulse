**Project Name:** NeuroPulse - Universal Adaptive Learning for ADHD Minds

**Description:**
I'm building a gamified microlearning platform that makes ANY subject learnable for adults with ADHD/dyspraxia. From quantum physics to plumbing, from Excel to electrical engineering - delivered in dopamine-optimized, bite-sized chunks that actually stick.

**Core MVP Features:**
- Dynamic topic system: Learn ANYTHING (chemistry, coding, plumbing, finance, languages)
- Adaptive session length: 5-10 minute bursts (not fixed question counts)
- Three difficulty paths with progression gates
- Multiple interaction types:
  * Multiple choice with confidence levels
  * Interactive diagrams (drag-and-drop)
  * Timed challenges with leaderboards
  * Visual matching exercises
- Instant dopamine rewards and progress tracking
- Learning journey tracker (2 weeks for enzymes â†’ 1 year for finance mastery)

**Universal Learning Examples:**
- Chemistry student: Interactive molecule building, timed equation balancing
- Electrician trainee: Wire virtual circuits before timer expires, safety quiz scenarios
- Data analyst: Drag correct formulas to spreadsheet cells, interpret visualizations
- Language learner: Audio matching, sentence construction puzzles
- Professional upskilling: Compliance scenarios, best practice challenges

**Design Philosophy:**
- Like Duolingo and Sololearn had a baby - beautiful, addictive, effective
- Every subject gets custom interaction types (not just text quizzes)
- Mobile-first but desktop-powerful
- Zero cognitive overload - one concept at a time
- Celebrates small wins constantly

**Technical Architecture:**
- Modular HTML/CSS/JS structure
- Component-based quiz types (easily add new interaction styles)
- Canvas API ready for interactive diagrams
- LocalStorage for progress across all subjects
- Prepared for OpenAI integration (adaptive content generation)
- Plugin architecture for future subject-specific modules

**Gamification 2.0:**
- Personal records per topic (fastest circuit wiring, chemistry streak)
- Global leaderboards for timed challenges
- Learning path visualization (see your journey)
- Milestone celebrations (first week, first month, topic mastery)
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on performance

**Learning Journey System:**
- Track multiple subjects simultaneously
- Visual progress maps per topic
- Estimated time to mastery (based on user's pace)
- Spaced repetition built into journey planning
- Achievement badges for depth (2-week sprints) and breadth (5+ topics)

**File Structure:**
- index.html (subject selector dashboard)
- quiz-engine.js (core quiz logic)
- interactions/
  * multiple-choice.js
  * drag-drop.js
  * timed-challenge.js
  * diagram-builder.js
- subjects/ (modular subject configs)
  * chemistry.js
  * electrical.js
  * finance.js
  * [easily add more]
- progress-tracker.js
- gamification.js

**Smart Features:**
- Auto-detect optimal session length per user
- Suggest next topic based on interests
- Adaptive difficulty within sessions
- "Deep dive" vs "Quick refresh" modes

**Vision for Growth:**
- Subject marketplace (community-created content)
- AI tutor for stuck moments
- Company training portals
- Integration with other neurodivergent tools
- Mobile app with offline mode
- VR/AR for spatial learners

**Success Metrics:**
- Users learn across multiple subjects (not just one)
- Sustained engagement over weeks/months
- Measurable knowledge retention
- "This changed how I learn" testimonials

**Target Users:**
Anyone with ADHD who wants to learn:
- Students cramming for exams
- Professionals upskilling
- Hobbyists going deep
- Career changers
- Curious minds exploring everything

**The Promise:**
"Learn anything, remember everything, love every minute."
Every subject becomes as addictive as your favorite game.
