# 🚀 NeuroPulse — Universal Adaptive Learning for ADHD Minds

## 🔍 Description

NeuroPulse is a gamified, modular microlearning engine designed for adults with ADHD, dyspraxia, or cognitive overload. It turns any topic—from circuits to finance—into interactive, dopamine-optimized 5–10 minute bursts of learning that actually stick.

Whether you're prepping for a career switch, revising for exams, or just pursuing curiosity, NeuroPulse makes learning feel more like a game than school.

## 🧰 Execution Tips (MVP Build Flow)

1. Start with static question arrays (`subjects/chemistry.js`, etc.)
2. Implement core engine: question loop + scoring
3. Add confidence rating + UI feedback
4. Wrap in `index.html` with clean, mobile-friendly UI
5. Use `localStorage` to save:
   - streaks
   - completed topics
   - personal bests
6. Add drag-drop/timed challenge modules one at a time
7. Post in ADHD, edtech, and learning forums for feedback

## 🧪 GPT Prompt for Auto-Generating Quizzes (Optional)

```txt
“Generate 10 confidence-rated multiple choice questions to teach the basics of [TOPIC] to an ADHD learner. Keep each question focused on one concept. Include short feedback and difficulty tags.”
✅ Ready to Build?
This project solves a real pain point, has a focused MVP, and is built from lived experience.

Start with:

/index.html

/quiz-engine.js

/subjects/chemistry.js

Then ship it early, iterate with feedback, and grow from there.

You've got this. 🚀
