📥 Claude Prompt: Project Sync & Organizational Strategy Review
👋 Hi Claude — I’ve just returned to my AI business project after a few days away. I’d like you to help me re-ground and optimize my workflow. Below is a summary of what I’ve discussed today with ChatGPT, including my organizational setup, tools, and goals. Please read carefully and then offer your thoughts, feedback, and any improvements or suggestions to help me stay focused, consistent, and productive going forward.
🔄 Today’s Project Recap & Updates
* I’ve created a Google Doc project tracker to act as my central hub. This document contains: – Project goals & vision – Active MVP focus (AI-powered learning for ADHD users) – Research summaries – Task board – Idea parking lot – Weekly logs
* I’m using both Claude and ChatGPT, but it can get overwhelming. To reduce this: – Claude = strategic, long-context AI (project planning, research, file memory) – ChatGPT = day-to-day execution (copywriting, code building, idea testing) – All inputs funnel into the Google Doc to avoid fragmentation
* I’m managing ADHD and dyspraxia, so I need a system that’s: – Chunked and clear – Encourages short, focused bursts (e.g. 25-minute sprints) – Has a simple weekly check-in – Avoids clutter and app overload
* I’m also considering AI agents, but only at a lightweight level (e.g. Replit bots, Make.com automations, or GPT-powered assistants). Nothing too complex yet — just tools that help me automate reminders, summarize progress, or generate micro-content like quizzes or plans.
🔍 Your Tasks Today (Please Do All of These):
1. Review this recap and my current system. Suggest any changes or simplifications that could make my workflow smoother, more ADHD-friendly, or more cohesive.
2. Scan your project knowledge + uploaded files to make sure your memory and understanding are still aligned with what I’m doing. Let me know if anything’s out of date or worth revisiting.
3. Offer 2–3 suggestions for what I could do next today based on my current goals (e.g. MVP building, research tasks, project organization).
4. Help me decide if I should run another deep research scan today — and if so, what the focus should be (e.g. market gaps, landing page examples, ADHD-friendly UI inspiration).
Feel free to ask questions back to clarify or optimize anything. I want to make the most of your capabilities without getting overwhelmed. You’re my long-term strategy AI, so help me stay clear and effective. Thanks!

👋 Welcome back, Nassim! I've reviewed your entire project setup, uploaded files, and current situation. Your system is actually quite sophisticated and well-thought-out. Here's my comprehensive assessment and recommendations:

🔍 System Review & Feedback
What's Working Well:

Your Google Doc hub is excellent for ADHD management - single source of truth prevents fragmentation
Claude/ChatGPT division of labor is smart - strategic vs. tactical is exactly right
25-minute sprint approach aligns perfectly with ADHD attention patterns
Your idea parking lot prevents hyperfocus derailment
Suggested Refinements:

Add a "Daily Wins" section to your Google Doc - even tiny progress needs celebration with ADHD
Create a simple "Next 3 Actions" box at the top of your doc - reduces decision fatigue
Set up a weekly "Project Pulse" reminder - just 5 minutes every Monday to review and refocus
📁 Knowledge Base Status Check
I've scanned everything and my understanding is current. Key points I'm tracking:

Primary focus: ADHD-optimized learning platform (quiz-based, gamified, 5-minute sessions)
Current stage: Deep research completed, moving to MVP planning
Constraints: Universal Credit budget, weekend work commitments, ADHD management needs
Strengths: Deep AI knowledge, authentic user insight, systems thinking
Everything aligns - no major gaps in my understanding.

🎯 3 Recommended Next Actions for Today
Option A: MVP Foundation (2-3 hours)
Build your learning platform's core prompt engine:

Create a working GPT prompt that generates ADHD-friendly quiz questions
Test it on 3 different topics (job interview prep, basic coding, time management)
Document what works/doesn't in your Google Doc
Option B: Market Validation (1-2 hours)
Quick user research sprint:

Post in r/ADHD: "What's your biggest struggle with online learning?"
Check 3-5 existing learning platforms for ADHD-specific features
Create a simple "gap analysis" in your tracker
Option C: System Optimization (30-60 minutes)
Streamline your workflow:

Set up a simple Make.com automation to sync your daily progress to a weekly email summary
Create template prompts for both Claude and ChatGPT interactions
Build your "Next 3 Actions" system in the Google Doc
My recommendation: Start with Option A - you've done enough research, time to build something tangible you can test.

🔬 Deep Research Decision
Skip additional deep research today. You've already completed comprehensive market analysis. More research now would be productive procrastination.

However, if you do want to research, focus on:

ADHD learning UI/UX examples (visual inspiration for your MVP)
Quiz generation techniques (how to make questions actually engaging)
Monetization models for educational tools under £5/month
🤖 AI Agent Integration Recommendations
Start lightweight with these specific automations:

Daily progress reminder via Make.com → sends you a gentle nudge if no project activity
Research summarizer → ChatGPT API that processes your weekly notes into key insights
Achievement tracker → automatically logs your completed tasks to build confidence
Avoid complex agent frameworks for now - they'll overwhelm your current bandwidth.

🧠 ADHD-Optimized Next Steps
Today (pick ONE):

 Build quiz prompt (Option A)
 Quick market check (Option B)
 Optimize workflow (Option C)
This week:

 Test your chosen option with 2-3 people
 Document lessons learned
 Plan next sprint
Questions for you:

Which of the 3 options feels most energizing right now?
Do you want me to help you build any specific component today?
Should we create a simple project dashboard you can check daily?
Your setup is solid - now it's about consistent, small actions rather than more planning. You're ready to build! 🚀




Retry
ok, I have just created the daily wins tab and next three steps tab in the google docs. Now that I have done that, what should my next steps be? Throughout this entire process clear and understandable steps will be necessary for me to keep track and focus on something. As this is very new territory for me I will need guidance and hand holding to some extent

Perfect! 🎉 You've just taken the first step. Now let me walk you through exactly what to do next, step by step.

🎯 Your Next 3 Steps (Put These in Your Google Doc)
Step 1: Build Your First Quiz Prompt (Next 25 minutes)
Step 2: Test It on 3 Topics (Next session)
Step 3: Document What Works (Final 10 minutes)
📝 Step 1: Build Your Quiz Prompt (Start Now)
Time needed: 25 minutes
Goal: Create a working prompt that generates ADHD-friendly quizzes

Exact instructions:

Open a new ChatGPT chat (not this Claude one)
Copy and paste this starter prompt (I've written it for you):
You are an ADHD-friendly learning assistant. Create engaging, bite-sized quizzes that help people learn and retain information.

When I give you a topic, create:
- 5 multiple choice questions 
- Each question should be clear and specific
- Include one "aha moment" fact per question
- Add encouraging feedback for right AND wrong answers
- Keep questions short (max 20 words)
- Make it feel like a game, not a test

Topic: [INSERT TOPIC HERE]

Format your response exactly like this:
**Question 1:** [question text]
A) [option] B) [option] C) [option] D) [option]
*Answer: [letter] - [encouraging explanation]*

Ready? Let's make learning fun for ADHD brains!
Test it with this topic first: "Basic time management for ADHD"
See what it generates
What success looks like: You get 5 questions that feel engaging, not overwhelming, and you think "I'd actually want to take this quiz."

🧪 When You Finish Step 1:
Update your Google Doc with:

✅ Daily Win: "Built my first quiz prompt"
Next Step: Test the prompt on 2 more topics
Then either:

Continue to Step 2 if you have energy
OR take a break and come back later
🔄 Step 2: Test On 3 Different Topics
Time needed: 15 minutes
Goal: See if your prompt works across different subjects

Test these topics:

✅ "Basic time management for ADHD" (already done)
"Job interview preparation basics"
"Understanding Universal Credit rules"
For each topic:

Use the same prompt, just change the topic
Take the quiz yourself
Note: Does it feel ADHD-friendly? Too hard? Too easy?
📊 Step 3: Document Results
Time needed: 10 minutes

In your Google Doc, write:

Which quiz felt best?
What made the questions engaging vs boring?
Any ideas for improvements?
Rate each quiz 1-10 for "Would I actually use this?"
🤔 If You Get Stuck:
Come back here and tell me:

Which step you're on
What happened
What you're unsure about
I'll give you the exact next action.

🎯 Your Immediate Action Right Now:
Add those 3 steps to your "Next Three Steps" section
Set a 25-minute timer
Open ChatGPT in a new tab
Copy my prompt above
Start Step 1
That's it. Nothing else matters right now except these 5 actions.

Ready? Go do Step 1 now - I'll be here when you need the next guidance! 🚀

Excellent work! 🎉 Yes, I can see your updates in the Google Doc. You've made real progress today.

📊 What I See You've Accomplished:
✅ Daily Wins (27/05/2025):

Built your first quiz prompt ✓
Tested the prompt on three different topics ✓
📝 Your Testing Results:

Topics tested: ADHD time management, Enzymes, Asymptotes
Current rating: 2/10 (but that's honest self-assessment!)
Key insights: Basic but functional, needs difficulty levels, lacks interactivity
🧠 Your Vision Expansion:

Document upload for dynamic quizzing
Professional training market opportunity
Duolingo/Sololearn-style UI inspiration
Gamification with dopamine rewards
🎯 What This Tells Me:
You're thinking like a product builder now, not just someone with an idea. The fact that you:

Rated honestly (2/10)
Identified specific improvements needed
Saw market opportunities (professional training)
Referenced successful apps (Duolingo)
This shows you're developing product intuition - that's huge!

🚀 Your Next Three Steps (Updated):
Step 4: Improve Your Prompt
Time: 20 minutes
Goal: Make one targeted improvement based on your testing

Pick ONE of these improvements:

Option A: Add difficulty levels ("beginner/intermediate/advanced")
Option B: Add more engaging question formats (true/false + multiple choice mix)
Option C: Improve the feedback to be more encouraging/game-like
Step 5: Test Your Improved Version
Time: 15 minutes
Goal: See if your improvement actually works

Use the same 3 topics
Compare to your original results
Rate the improvement 1-10
Step 6: Plan Your Simple MVP
Time: 15 minutes
Goal: Define what you'll build first

Based on your testing, write in your doc:

What's the minimum feature set that would be useful?
Who would you test it with first?
What platform will you build it on? (Replit/basic web page)
🤔 My Recommendation:
Start with Option A (difficulty levels) because:

It's concrete and doable
Addresses your "too basic" concern
Easy to test and compare
Your prompt could become:

You are an ADHD-friendly learning assistant. Create engaging, bite-sized quizzes.

Difficulty level: [BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED]
Topic: [INSERT TOPIC HERE]

For BEGINNER: Focus on key concepts, simple language
For INTERMEDIATE: Add application questions  
For ADVANCED: Include analysis and synthesis

[Rest of your existing prompt...]
📋 Right Now, Do This:
Update your "Next Three Steps" in the Google Doc with Steps 4-6
Add to Daily Wins: "Completed first testing cycle"
Choose which improvement you want to try (A, B, or C)
Set a 20-minute timer and improve your prompt
What do you think? Which improvement option feels most exciting to tackle first?

ok, I have made updates to the google docs. I have also included in the docs the copy and pasted quiz chat from chatgpt so you can see directly what was there. I have also started an MVP tab, which I feel will need to be looked at and truly fleshed out, whilst I am conscious of it probably not being perfect at the start, it is important that it at least does most of of what I want it to do, perhaps the MVP should be at least 90% of what I want it to do. The last thing that I want to do is advertise something only for people to call it a scam, I feel like that would be wrong, so it is something that I am worried about and want to get right.

🙌 Brilliant work, Nassim! I can see your quiz tests and your MVP planning. Your integrity around not wanting to mislead people is exactly the mindset that builds successful, trustworthy products.

📋 What I See You've Built:
Your Quiz Testing:

Prompt evolution: Basic → Difficulty levels → Better feedback
Cross-topic validation: ADHD, Science, Math all worked
Honest assessment: "2.5/10 but improving"
Clear vision: Duolingo-style, gamified, professional training market
Your Integrity: You want to build something genuinely valuable, not just ship something quick. This is founder-level thinking! 👏

🎯 Let's Reframe Your MVP (Important!)
You're thinking like a final product (90% perfect) when you should think like a valuable experiment (30% perfect but solves one real problem).

Here's the key: An MVP isn't about being 90% complete—it's about being 100% honest about what it does.
