**Project Name:** NeuroPulse - ADHD Learning Revolution


**Description:**
I'm building a gamified microlearning platform for adults with ADHD/dyspraxia that makes learning feel like playing Duolingo or Sololearn. This isn't just a quiz generator - it's designed to become a comprehensive learning system that hits dopamine receptors and creates genuine retention.


**Immediate MVP (Build This First):**
- Welcome/start screen with motivating message
- Topic input with autocomplete suggestions
- Difficulty selector: Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced
- 5-question adaptive quiz cycles
- Confidence-based answering: "Sure!" / "Think So" / "Guessing"
- Instant dopamine rewards: colorful celebrations, encouraging messages
- Score tracking with visual progress bar
- "Next Topic" or "Try Again" options


**Core Design Principles:**
- Clean, approachable UI like Duolingo/Sololearn
- Large touch targets (min 44x44px for mobile)
- Calm base colors (blues/greens) with dopamine-triggering accents
- Smooth animations (not jarring)
- 16px+ fonts, high contrast
- Generous white space, no clutter


**Technical Architecture:**
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- LocalStorage for streak tracking
- Prepared for OpenAI API integration
- Clean, modular code for easy expansion


**Gamification Elements:**
- Visual progress bars that fill up
- Streak counter (days in a row)
- Achievement unlocks (study 3 days, complete 10 quizzes, etc.)
- Tier progression: Must score 95%+ to unlock next difficulty
- Encouraging failure messages ("Almost there! Your brain is growing!")


**Professional Training Focus:**
- Quick 5-minute learning bursts for busy professionals
- Topics relevant to workplace upskilling
- Future: Document upload for custom corporate training
- Bite-sized chunks perfect for mandatory training


**User Flow:**
1. Welcome screen: "Ready to level up your brain?"
2. Topic selection: "What shall we master today?"
3. Difficulty choice (locked tiers add intrigue)
4. 5 engaging questions with confidence selection
5. Instant feedback with learning reinforcement
6. Celebration screen with options to continue


**File Structure:**
- index.html (welcome/home screen)
- quiz.html (main quiz interface)
- styles.css (clean, ADHD-optimized styling)
- app.js (quiz logic, state management)
- gamification.js (streaks, achievements, progress)
- api-prep.js (ready for OpenAI integration)


**Future Vision (Not in MVP but design for it):**
- Question variety: true/false, drag-drop, visual matching
- AI-generated diagrams and visual explanations
- Document upload for professional courses
- Mini-games between quiz sessions
- Spaced repetition algorithm
- Social features (compete with friends)
- Audio/visual question options
- Corporate team dashboards


**Success Metrics:**
- Users complete full quiz sets (not abandoning mid-way)
- Users return multiple days (streak building)
- 80%+ positive feedback on focus and enjoyment
- Average session time 5-10 minutes


**Target Users:**
Adult professionals with ADHD who:
- Struggle with traditional online courses
- Need to upskill for work but find training boring
- Want quick wins and dopamine hits
- Learn better through gamification
- Have 5-10 minutes here and there (not hour-long sessions)


**Key Differentiator:**
This isn't homework - it's a game that happens to teach. Every interaction should spark joy and make users want to come back. Think "Duolingo for anything you want to learn."
