Potential Business Ideas:
-            Long term experience bank – Throughout my time applying for apprenticeships, going through cover letters, CV’s and other application formats, I wished that I had some sort of data base of all of my potentially relevant experiences so that I could easily reference and refresh myself on all of them in varying detail. I know that I have lots of relevant life/educational experiences but the idea that something could exist that could keep them logged from early childhood right the way through somebodies’ entire life. This was when doing things like applications etc you could reference those relevant experiences from a genuine, personal historical data base. For example, say you worked on a school project in year 10 that was quite technical or something, then 7 years later you are applying for a position somewhere, odds are you forget you ever had that very relevant experience that could boost your odds for a successful application and instead may focus on just the usual/generic stuff such as certified qualifications etc, which are still relevant but could be boosted by having something that has a detailed list of other potentially relevant information. (This is potentially not a good idea etc, just thought I would write my ideas down anyway)
-            Custom learning/Comprehensive AI courses (potentially with recognized certificates) – I feel as though with the coming of AI and perhaps soon AGI and super intelligence, conventional education is more than outdated. Whilst still useful for in person interaction etc, AI will be much better at teaching and tutoring than most human teachers. I have always struggled with ADHD and dyspraxia and even though education tries to take neurodivergence into account, it doesn’t do it very well. This idea is essentially not just an AI custom tutor, as to be honest I’d imagine many of those already exist, but one that considers the specific needs and traits of the person that it is tutoring. For example, depending on who the person is, the course or topic could be delivered in a more suitable, beneficial way. When it comes to myself for example, I tend to do much better when learning is gamified. When taking part in the reed online courses in my free time, I noticed how outdated they were, they essentially uploaded lectures and slideshows and expect people to earn optimally through that. However, I have found things like sololearn far better at teaching something like coding or data than any of the reed courses could have. I feel as though learning is specific to the individual and an education platform that recognizes that and seamlessly tailors itself to what the individual needs is beneficial. For example, when trying to recall information on a subject for one of my applications, instead of just trying to read the information into my head I used chatgpt to create a quiz style app with as much of the information as possible. I learnt a lot better through that method. The idea here is something that can do the same kind of thing but for everyone. I feel like this would have to rely on algorithms rather than hard code, due to the nature of the AI creating a personalized education experience per individual. It is also worth noting that when using chatgpt to create the codebase and question bank there were noticeable limits. It found it difficult to generate a full clean codebase and often made mistakes, e.g. it would generate 36 relevant questions rather than the 50 that I had asked it for. Perhaps hallucinations and perhaps the limits of chatgpt at the time when it comes to generating full complex codebases. Perhaps compute limit, I don’t know.
-            The most recent idea that I have come up with currently is that of human onboarding. I was watching a podcast in which AI agents were discussed and how they will essentially need onboarding so that it has relevant context and experience so that it can fill a role properly etc. Essentially an induction in many ways so that the AI can understand what it needs to do. I had the idea today that with the rapid advancement of AI technology and agents just around the corner, that human onboarding will also be essential. The idea is that this can help the AI understand you better and thus be more beneficial and helpful to an individual specifically. For example, psychometric tests that the person would take to give the AI an understanding of the individual that it is supporting. For example, AI has been far more beneficial to me given that it is aware of my ADHD etc. Imagine the AI could ask the individual questions to try and understand them and help them better. This could also work for tutoring, like a mock test so that the AI understands where someone is at. I feel as though in human terms, you are able to help someone best when you understand them and can see where they most need help. (Is this a potential business idea, something that can onboard both humans and the AI so that traits and competency is better understood, so that techniques can more adequately be tailored to the individual)
