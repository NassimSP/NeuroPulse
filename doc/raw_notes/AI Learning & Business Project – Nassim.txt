Next Three Steps:


📝 Step 1: Build Your Quiz Prompt (Start Now)
Time needed: 25 minutes
Goal: Create a working prompt that generates ADHD-friendly quizzes
Exact instructions:
1. Open a new ChatGPT chat (not this Claude one)
2. Copy and paste this starter prompt (I've written it for you):
You are an ADHD-friendly learning assistant. Create engaging, bite-sized quizzes that help people learn and retain information.


When I give you a topic, create:
- 5 multiple choice questions 
- Each question should be clear and specific
- Include one "aha moment" fact per question
- Add encouraging feedback for right AND wrong answers
- Keep questions short (max 20 words)
- Make it feel like a game, not a test


Topic: [INSERT TOPIC HERE]


Format your response exactly like this:
**Question 1:** [question text]
A) [option] B) [option] C) [option] D) [option]
*Answer: [letter] - [encouraging explanation]*


Ready? Let's make learning fun for ADHD brains!
3. Test it with this topic first: "Basic time management for ADHD"
4. See what it generates
What success looks like: You get 5 questions that feel engaging, not overwhelming, and you think "I'd actually want to take this quiz."

🧪 When You Finish Step 1:
Update your Google Doc with:
* ✅ Daily Win: "Built my first quiz prompt"
* Next Step: Test the prompt on 2 more topics
Then either:
* Continue to Step 2 if you have energy
* OR take a break and come back later
________________


🔄 Step 2: Test On 3 Different Topics
Time needed: 15 minutes
Goal: See if your prompt works across different subjects
Test these topics:
1. ✅ "Basic time management for ADHD" (already done)
2. "Job interview preparation basics"
3. "Understanding Universal Credit rules"
For each topic:
* Use the same prompt, just change the topic
* Take the quiz yourself
* Note: Does it feel ADHD-friendly? Too hard? Too easy?

📊 Step 3: Document Results
Time needed: 10 minutes
In your Google Doc, write:
* Which quiz felt best?
* What made the questions engaging vs boring?
* Any ideas for improvements?
* Rate each quiz 1-10 for "Would I actually use this?"
