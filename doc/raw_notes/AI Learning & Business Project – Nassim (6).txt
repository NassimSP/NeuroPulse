Notes about project


27/05/2025:


* Created the first prompt, I tested the prompt using three different topics. The first topic was "Basic time management for ADHD", the second was “Enzymes” and the third was “Asymptotes”. It worked well, the quiz seemed ADHD friendly however, I do note that this is just the start. It is quite basic at the moment and definitely needs a difficulty level. At a later stage I would also like to include AI generated diagrams so that this can go from a basic multiple choice quiz to something more complex and actually worth using for people of all skill levels, on whatever topic they would like. I would perhaps like a system as well where people can upload specific documents or course details and be dynamically quizzed on them. For example, I have header that there is a gap in the market for a professional training/courses, as most professionals don’t have much time to spend on courses that their companies tell them to go on, so something where a worker or developer who has to spend a certain amount of time per week training could upload the contents of the course that they have to go through and perhaps be dynamically quizzed on topics in a gamified way that could speed up learning and reduce training/upskilling times. This would be both beneficial to the employee as well as the employer. This could be useful for anyone as well. As far as ratings for each quiz, I would give them all a 2 at the moment, especially when thinking about what I would want it to be in the future.


* I also note the interactivity of it was lacking, this is understandable as this was a test on chat gpt for now. However, going forward with this I would like a dedicated application to do this, I am inspired by things like Duolingo or Sololearn which I have used which are really good at this, they make the UI feel clean and easy to approach, the aesthetic of these apps really goes along way for some people. I’d definitely like the app to be more complex and feel like a genuinely comprehensive, professional and beneficial learning experience whilst feeling like a game as well. It needs to hit those dopamine receptors if people are going to use it and come back to it and actually get anything out of it. Perhaps mini games. 


*  Perhaps adding a tier level to gamify progression as well. Also for the app, in order to move up to intermediate from beginner you must pass a gamified quiz with 95% or something, this may perhaps encourage that side of people that just plug away until they get it etc. For more advanced levels maybe 98% for example. 


* I have just tested the 2nd test prompt, it was better and definitely offers a more tailored set of questions depending on the knowledge level. It is a good start, I would rate it a 2.5 out of 10. Whilst it is better and improving, it is still nowhere near where I would want it to be. The questions are getting better, and I think that over time I would like it to get to a point where as an app it can really tailor the questions and learning experience to the individual, so that It can act as a truly dynamic and personalised learning tool. Whilst it is less basic than before, it definitely has a long way to go before I actually have a product that I can reasonably and morally market.
