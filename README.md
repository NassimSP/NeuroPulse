# NeuroPulse 🧠⚡️  
*Gamified, AI-powered learning tailored for ADHD and neurodivergent minds.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

NeuroPulse is designed to help learners who struggle with traditional education formats — especially those with ADHD, dyspraxia, or executive dysfunction.

We combine adaptive microlearning, gamification, and intelligent progress tracking into a dynamic learning platform powered by GPT-4.

> Think “Duolingo meets ChatGPT for neurodivergent focus.”
